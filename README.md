## Project Overview

*MedSecure* is a digital platform designed to allow patients to manage their healthcare records, book appointments, and communicate securely with healthcare professionals. Since the app processes sensitive health data, this DPIA focuses on identifying cybersecurity risks and ensuring data privacy compliance.

## Key Documents

- *[DPIA Report (PDF)](./DPIA_Report_MedSecure.pdf)*: Outlines the purpose, scope, findings, and mitigation strategies.
- *[Privacy Risk Matrix (Excel)](./Privacy_Risk_Matrix.xlsx)*: Categorizes risks by likelihood and impact with mitigation recommendations.

## Data Flow Diagram

- [Data Flow Diagram](https://github.com/Adersh-hari/Data-Privacy-Assessment---MedSecure/blob/main/Data%20flow%20diagram.jpg)

This diagram illustrates how data flows between users, the MedSecure mobile application, backend servers, and healthcare providers.

## Risk Assessment

Identified risks include:
- Undefined data retention policy
- Security gaps in third-party services
- Inadequate authentication mechanisms

Each risk has been assessed and paired with practical mitigation strategies to reduce potential harm and enhance privacy.

## Technologies Used

- Python (for report and diagram generation)
- Excel (risk matrix)
- Markdown (documentation)
- Git/GitHub (version control)

## Project Status

*Completed*  
This project is part of a cybersecurity academic portfolio and not implemented in a real environment.
